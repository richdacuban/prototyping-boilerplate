# TEC Opt-In ad assignment

This is a simple and quick demo project created for Thought and Expression Company to demo a simple session based system for allowing a user to opt-in to see ads that may otherwise be objectionable.

This project uses only plain html, plain javascript and css styling. The internal "ads" are in iframes and communicate with the parent window via postMessage and the data is stored in the parent and child windows via sessionStorage
